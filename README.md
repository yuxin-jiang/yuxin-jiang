# Hi there 👋 !

I am Yuxin Jiang. I am currently a Ph.D. student at Huazhong University of Science and Technology under the supervision of Prof. [Weiming Shen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=FuSHsx4AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).

**My research focuses on Anomaly Detection, involving Vision-Language Models, Image Generation, and Computer Vision, etc.**

**If you are interested in my academic researches, please feel free to contact me at any time, and I will be happy to communicate with you!** 😊😊😊

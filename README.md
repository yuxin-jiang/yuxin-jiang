# Hi there 👋

I'm **Yuxin Jiang**  
Ph.D. Candidate @ Huazhong University of Science and Technology  
Supervised by Prof. [Weiming Shen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=FuSHsx4AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate)

## 🎯 Research Focus
My work centers on **Anomaly Detection** in computer vision, with cross-domain integration of:
- Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for semantic-aware anomaly reasoning
- Image Generation techniques for synthetic anomaly data augmentation
- General Computer Vision pipelines for industrial & academic scenario deployment
- 
If you're interested in collaborative research or academic exchanges, feel free to reach out anytime! I'm always open to discussing novel ideas in anomaly detection and related fields 😄
